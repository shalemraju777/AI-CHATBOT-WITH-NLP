### What is an AI Chatbot?

An **AI chatbot** is a software application that simulates human-like conversations using artificial intelligence. It can interact with users via text or voice, answering questions, providing assistance, or performing tasks — often used in customer support, personal assistants, and business automation.

Unlike basic rule-based bots that follow fixed scripts, **AI-powered chatbots** use **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to understand and generate human-like responses dynamically.

### What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

**NLP** is a branch of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to read, understand, interpret, and generate natural language. Key areas in NLP include:

* **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into words or phrases.
* **Part-of-speech tagging**: Identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.
* **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying names, places, dates, etc.
* **Intent recognition**: Understanding the user's goal or question.
* **Sentiment analysis**: Detecting emotions or tone in a message.

By using NLP, chatbots can process user input more intelligently and provide context-aware, accurate responses.

### How Does an AI Chatbot with NLP Work?

An AI chatbot with NLP typically follows these steps:

1. **User Input**: A user types or speaks a query, such as “What’s the weather today?”
2. **NLP Engine**: The chatbot uses NLP to:

   * Clean and tokenize the input
   * Identify intent (e.g., weather query)
   * Extract entities (e.g., "today", "weather", "location")
3. **Processing**: The bot uses logic or external APIs to find the answer.
4. **Response Generation**: The bot constructs a natural-language reply (e.g., “It’s 29°C and sunny in Bangalore today.”)
5. **Learning (optional)**: With machine learning, the chatbot can improve over time from interactions.
